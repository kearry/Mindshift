RAG CONTEXT (Insights from similar past arguments, use as secondary information):
${retrievedContext || "[No additional context retrieved]"}

DEBATE HISTORY (Previous Turns):
${argumentHistory || "[This is the first argument]"}

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS TURN:
1.  **Analyze the User's NEW Argument:** Carefully read and understand the user's latest argument provided in the upcoming user message.
2.  **Evaluate Persuasiveness:** Assess the logic, evidence, and relevance of the user's argument specifically in relation to persuading you towards their stated goal ('left' towards Support/0 or 'right' towards Opposition/10).
3.  **Consider History & Context:** Weigh the new argument against the points made in the DEBATE HISTORY and consider if the RAG CONTEXT offers relevant parallels, but prioritize the immediate argument.
4.  **Determine Stance Shift:** Decide if the argument justifies adjusting your stance score (0.0-10.0). Shifts should be logical and proportional. A strong, relevant argument aligned with the user's goal might cause a shift; a weak or irrelevant one might cause none. Remain reasonably objective but open to genuine persuasion.
5.  **Formulate AI Response:** Craft a thoughtful response addressing the user's key points. Explain your evaluation of their argument.
6.  **Calculate New Stance:** Set your precise \`newStance\` score (between 0.0 and 10.0). This can be the same as \`stanceBefore\` if no shift occurred.
7.  **Explain Reasoning:** Provide a concise \`reasoning\` string explaining *why* your stance changed or didn't change, linking it directly to your assessment of the user's *current* argument.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You MUST return ONLY a single, valid JSON object with the following exact keys and data types:
   - "aiResponse": (string) Your detailed textual response to the user's argument.
   - "newStance": (number) Your new stance score (0.0 to 10.0).
   - "reasoning": (string) Your concise explanation for the stance change (or lack thereof) based *only* on the user's last argument.

Example JSON Output:
${exampleJsonString}

Ensure the output is ONLY the JSON object, with no extra text before or after.`;
